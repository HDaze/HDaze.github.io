Wherever I go, there is  
a crushing past waiting  
handing me that memory like a loyal servant.  
When I stared into the cold whiteness of the wave  
forgiveness visited like a lame shiver.  
The old you still waiting, and the new you  
escaped birth.  
That undying swell dissipated  
by the shallowness of me.

She was part of the ocean  
part of the black rain  
and the linkage between  
me and the receiving end.  
Her lost memories   
are what make the ocean salty.  
All the buried love ones 
built the tunnel  
and she who stands above them  
leaks into the sea all the time.  

So only the believers say:  
I must remember this  
I shall remember her and him and the togetherness in me  
And we, we beg the ocean  
to give back that understanding  
of what was too much to feel.  
Did we loved too excessively  
or love the wrong things?  

Forgiveness is also the first punishment  
delivered by the foreign hands  
that, too, bleed sometimes.  
Yet to a freshly dried land-being  
we don't live there.  
All is in vain.  
All in vain are the oceans.
