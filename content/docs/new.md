> -	To one who has been long in city pent,
> -	{:.indent-2}'Tis very sweet to look into the fair
> -	{:.indent-2}And open face of heaven,â€”to breathe a prayer
> -	Full in the smile of the blue firmament.
> -	Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,
> -	{:.indent-2}Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair
> -	{:.indent-2}Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair
> -	And gentle tale of love and languishment?
> -    
> -	Returning home at evening, with an ear
> -	{:.indent-2}Catching the notes of Philomel,â€”an eye
> -	Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,
> -	{:.indent-2}He mourns that day so soon has glided by:
> -	E'en like the passage of an angel's tear
> -	{:.indent-2}That falls through the clear ether silently.
