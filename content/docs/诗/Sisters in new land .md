## Sister, We Were the Sea in the New Land

Take a breath, and  
back to where you were,   
to the molten water  
you told me.  
My heart is becoming freezing air  
And the lungs are heavy anchors, brimmed with stones and sand  
and resentment  
I clutch at your ankle, my baby sister,  
But once again I am cast adrift  
coil like a lost eel	 
the one you crashed with your bare feet  


We no longer swim  
since you taught me how to  
float, holding my breath  
for the longest time  
in search  
in transit  
And we both died a little, the first time  
we crawled into the torched land  
as new species   


Didn’t you know? There is no more new land  
Everything has been touched  
And everything touched me have moved me  
away from the blessed unknown   
from the forgiveness  
Didn’t you know?  
Everything can be God, and only us  
can be us  


Take a breath, and  
FIRE!  
You commanded in a low voice, sitting in the lighted house  
our home, built of sand and waves  
Unlike you, I despise the violence of  
survival  
My worries were without aim  
but the first smell of the burning  
the burning of mourning, on the last celebration day  
my hatred of the strange land  
is a stillborn yearning   
for your love  

We have always been two kinds of seeds  
cannot be sowed in the same vineyard  
Your soft tongue is sunbaked  
has a taste of the pain I fed you  
Mine is always pronouncing old names  
Your name  
can never be matched with phonetic symbols  
You, my sister  
the inhabitant from the conqueror   
the bronze serpent.  


Take a breath,  
my sister  
we will die here in the strange land  
me as a foreign creature with limp ribs  
you, a me in waiting  
in search  
in transit  
we will die here in the strange land  
fall like two defiled fruits
